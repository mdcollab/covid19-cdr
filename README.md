# Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Clinical Data Repository

This is an effort to compile a repository of the clinical characteristics of patients who have taken a COVID-19 test. By sharing our schema and data, we hope that we can 1) accelerate information sharing among frontline healthcare providers and 2) facilitate studies on COVID-19 signs, symptoms, stages, and care plans.

## The Repository

The repository is maintained as [CSV files](https://github.com/mdcollab/covidclinicaldata/tree/master/data/) and in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11IuOqJ_L0wYcbDqovmDaASR2aae79I5a9wpGVOuQ9bU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sheets</a> and is compliant with <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard" target="_blank">HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard</a>. Details about each field are available in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p9rtv2LjVCPb54MdGe8ZqJ1zF3McIFnzq-ZhhjWgguI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">data dictionary</a>.

### Refresh Cadence and Organization 

* Each file contains a week's worth of results from Carbon Health and Braid Health.  
* Each filename is prefixed with the date (mm-dd) the query was run, matching `batch_date`.
* Each row contains the clinical characteristics of a patient who has taken a COVID-19 test. 
* The first batch, prefixed with 04-07, contains a month's worth of results starting from 03-07.

### Supplementary Material

* Motivations, details, and next steps are available in this [discussion](https://twitter.com/erenbali/status/1261083321158770689?s=20) from May 2020.
* Data preparation and summarization functions are available in these [two notebooks](https://github.com/mdcollab/covidclinicaldata/tree/master/notebooks/). For example, below is a visualization of the fill rate for all variables within the data repository.

### Carbon Health — Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings

- Website: <a href="https://carbonhealth.com/coronavirus" target="_blank">Carbon Health</a>
- Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/CarbonHealth" target="_blank">@CarbonHealth</a>
- Email: <covidclinicaldata@carbonhealth.com>
- Notes: 
    * Carbon Health began COVID-19 testing with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR test on 03-04-20. 
    * The data includes **clinical characteristics** (epi factors, comorbidities, vitals, clinician-assessed symptoms, patient-reported symptoms) in addition to **radiological** and **laboratory** findings. It does not include **treatment plans**, **complications**, and **clinical outcomes**, which is collected at inpatient facilities.
    * The data includes both positive and negative test results. These include results from symptomatic patients, those in professions with a high risk of exposure, and/or those who may have been exposed through contact with a known infected person. The data also includes test results for asymptomatic patients. 
    * The data includes test results of patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic patients. It does not include results for patients with severe symptoms. We refer such patients to ER.
    * A patient's reported age differs from their actual age by a reasonable randomized amount to protect their privacy.
    * It is important to note that our data collection is clinically-driven and therefore not systematic. This means that overall positive rates are descriptive of the Carbon Health patient population and cannot be generalized to the unobserved population. We do provide [functions](https://github.com/mdcollab/covidclinicaldata/blob/master/notebooks/a_utils.ipynb) to identify symptom severity to aid in accounting for the various admission criteria that affect positive rates.

- Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/BraidHealth" target="_blank">@BraidHealth</a>
- Email: <vivian@braid.health> and <k@braid.health>
- Notes:
    * The data is joined with Carbon Health data using the MRN and encounter ID fields, which are then excluded from the data.
    * The data includes findings, clinician impressions, labels, and links to chest x-rays. 
    * The links direct to the Braid Health website. 
    * The website UI allows for closer inspection by researchers and radiologists. 
    * The images can be downloaded for image processing and classification studies.
    * A patient’s reported age differs from their actual age by a reasonable randomized amount to protect their privacy.
